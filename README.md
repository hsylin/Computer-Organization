# Computer Organization Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the Computer Organization course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment, with additional details available in the accompanying PDF and PPT files, as well as the code in each directory.

1. **C to Assembly Translation**: This assignment focuses on converting given C code segments into their corresponding assembly language representations.

2. **Assembly Code Implementation**: In this task, I wrote assembly code for designated operations using the RV64I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The report includes performance statistics, detailing the values of four counters, total cycle count, and other relevant metrics.

3. **Cache Simulation**: The final assignment involved implementing four different cache replacement policies within the cache simulation module of Spike, allowing for comparative analysis of their performance.

I have implemented extensive functionality beyond the basic requirements for each assignment, and I encourage you to explore the code and documentation for a comprehensive understanding of my work.
