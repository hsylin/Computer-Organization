# Computer Organization Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the **Computer Organization** course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment. You can find more details in the corresponding PDF, PPT files (containing the assignment requirements), and the code in each directory.

## 1. C to Assembly Translation
- **Objective**: Convert given C code segments into their corresponding assembly language representations.
- **Assignment Details**: [PPT](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/raw/main/HW1/CO_2023_HW1.pptx)           [PDF](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/blob/main/HW1/CO_2023_HW1.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW1` directory.

## 2. Assembly Code Implementation
- **Objective**: Write assembly code for designated operations using the RV64I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and analyze performance statistics, detailing the values of four counters, total cycle count, and other relevant metrics.
- **Assignment Details**: [PPT](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/raw/main/HW2/CO_2023_HW2.pptx)           [PDF](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/raw/main/HW2/CO_2023_HW2.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW2` directory.

## 3. Cache Simulation
- **Objective**: Implement four different cache replacement policies within the cache simulation module of Spike and analyze their performance.
- **Assignment Details**: [PPT](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/raw/main/HW3/CO_2023_HW3.pptx)           [PDF](https://github.com/hsylin/Computer-Organization/raw/main/HW3/CO_2023_HW3.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW3` directory.
